        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is one hundred percent Chilean. It is a sort of caramel that can be found everywhere in Chile.</p>
        <p>Actually, most pastry making in my country has manjar in it. The truth is that one can eat manjar anytime during the day and in many different ways: with bread, cheese, cookies, and my favorite, with meringue.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 quart whole milk</li>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Bring milk, sugar, and vanilla extract to a boil in a saucepan over high heat.
                Reduce heat to medium-low, continue cooking, and continuously stirring until milk has thickened and turned a caramel color, about 1 hour or more.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir in baking soda. Continue cooking until caramelized milk has reached a pudding consistency.
                Pour manjar into a bowl and cool completely in the refrigerator.
            </li>
        </ol>
